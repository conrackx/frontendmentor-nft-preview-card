## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Not only the making process but how to optimize some aspects of the ode, for example single-line css classes for easier usage like

```css
html {font-size: 62.5%;}
```
the usage of transparency
```css
.overlay {
  ...
  background: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
  ...
}
```
as well as icons in css
```css
.card-content .card-price .price i {
  content: url(./images/icon-ethereum.svg);
  ...
}
```

### Continued development

i still have a lot lo learn and would like to correct some of the unresolved issues this have like the position of the icons.
